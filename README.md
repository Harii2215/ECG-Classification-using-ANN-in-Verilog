# HDL and Neural Network Demo

This repository contains two primary components:

1. **Verilog HDL Code**  
   File: `VERILOG_CODE.v`  
   This file contains hardware description language (HDL) code written in Verilog. It can be used for digital circuit simulation and design using tools like ModelSim, Vivado, or Icarus Verilog.

2. **Python Neural Network Weights & Biases Demo**  
   File: `Python_program_for_WEIGHTS&BIASES.ipynb`  
   This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how weights and biases are initialized and processed in a simple neural network setting using Python. Itâ€™s intended for educational purposes, particularly for beginners exploring how neural networks compute outputs layer by layer.

## Getting Started

### Verilog Code
You can simulate the Verilog code using any simulator that supports IEEE 1364 standard. For example:
